## Monopoly

#### Automatic banker for games like Monopoly using Node.js and Socket.IO. Also keeps a log of all transactions to ensure everyone is playing fairly!

### Instructions
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Start the server with `npm start`.
3. Players go to `http://localhost/play/John` *(where John is the player's name)*

### Notes
- May require `sudo` permissions in order for the app to be run on port 80. If this is a problem, the port can be changed in `app.js`.
- `localhost` can obviously be replaced with your computer's IP address or hostname for example when connecting across a network.
- The `npm` command is required, it can be installed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
